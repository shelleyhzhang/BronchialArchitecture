Structural analysis of human lung airway 
The project inputs the centerline network of the lung airway and calculates 
1) the longest distance from trachea to the endpoints as "carinaToPleura"
2) the smallest bending radius among branch junctions within the right upper lobe as "radius"
3) the largest bending angle among branch junctions within the right upper lobe as "angle"
